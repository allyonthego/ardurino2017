# ardurino2017
Samples of code from my WE Go.DEsign project. The language is a modified version of C used by Ardurino. Uploading this code from the computer to the motherboard results in physical changes (motors, sensors, lights). Being self-taught, I had not yet discovered the usefulness of code documentation nor of code organization.
